# VOIDSPIRE™ Outreach Pack v1  
Reflex801 — Ground-Truth AI for Human Voices

## 1. Mission
Build the first **human-grounded AI** ecosystem from real SME voices (VoiceGold → G-Roots → VOID-SPINE).  
We aim to connect global researchers, AI pioneers, and ecosystem partners to bring Reflex801 to the world.

## 2. Why This Matters
- AI is missing **ground-truth emotional signals**  
- Current datasets are synthetic or scraped  
- Reflex801 collects real human voices → PDPA compliant → Custodian governed  
- Creates the missing “hidden layer” for world-models

## 3. What We Offer to Partners
- Field-audio samples (anonymized)  
- Emotional-signature YAML  
- PDPA-cleaned datasets  
- Field-intelligence deck  
- Real human behavioral signals for model research  

## 4. Who We Are Reaching Out To
- Yann LeCun  
- Jeremy Howard  
- Fei-Fei Li  
- Andrej Karpathy  
- Demis Hassabis  
- Jad Tarifi (Integral AI)
